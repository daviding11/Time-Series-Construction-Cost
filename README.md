# Time-Series-Construction-Cost
Forecasting residential construction costs in a particular neighborhood is useful to 
potential homeowners and investors because it provides pertinent information as to what 
they can expect to budget for a particular project. Knowing the costs in advance allows 
investors or homeowners to plan accordingly and set aside the right amount of money that 
they need to complete the necessary construction or renovations. If the relevant information 
and estimated values were unknown, the volatility in both material and labor costs could pose as 
an economic danger between all the parties involved in a contract. Therefore, we hope to hedge 
against that risk by forecasting costs for future months and by providing sound estimates of 
future costs using a model that we believe best represents our data.
